A challenge all technical leaders, managers and developers have is keeping abreast of the latest changes in relevant technology areas.

One way I've found of keeping on top of things, without getting snowed under, is weekly mailing lists or newsletters for topics or specific technologies.
These do all the hard work of separating the wheat from the chaff and give you a short digest of the most important or popular news.

Over the years I've accumulated quite a few subscriptions to these sorts of mailing lists, and I thought it might be useful to share with others.
With that said, here's everything I'm currently subscribed to:

For specific libraries or frameworks you or your teams use you might want to consider subscribing to their release notifications on GitHub so you know about major releases as they happen.

I'd highly recommend automating dependency upgrades where possible to reduce the maintenance burden on developers and ensure you are always up-to-date with the latest improvements and bug fixes; this is dependent on you having good test coverage and trusting your tests and pipelines.

Of course I couldn't finish a post on technology news without mentioning the infamous [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com), another great resource for technology news and opinions.

Any good newsletters or resources I missed that you've found helpful? [Let me know](https://github.com/josephearl/website/issues/new).
