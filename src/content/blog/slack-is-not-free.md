[Slack's free tier](https://slack.com/pricing) is an unlimited trial period, not a permanent solution for your business.

It might look tempting to use this forever -- you can have unlimited users, but the limitation is in the fine print in the bullet points below:

> up to 10k of your team’s most recent messages

> 5GB total file storage for the team

Would you use an email service that only kept your whole companies' most recent 10,000 messages? 5GB storage shared across _everyone_?

It might seem like a lot now, but unless you have very few users you'll hit those limits quicker than you think.

When you do, you won't be able to upload files (no more funny cat pictures) or see that important message from the start of the month by the end of it.

Make sure you're willing to pay the price for one of the higher tiers when you start trialling Slack if you and your business want to have the best Slack experience.
