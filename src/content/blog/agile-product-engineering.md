If you looked at most organisations that deliver digital products today, at where the people involved in delivering the products spent their time, you may not be surprised to find that the vast majority of almost all employees time is spent on the development and delivery process!

This might seem obvious, and therefore expected, and so perhaps even not to be questioned, but -- is it really the goal?

_What if our goal was to spend as much time as possible focused on the customer, the outcomes and the impact over the tools and the implementation?_

Not just the product managers or executives, but **everyone** involved in product delivery. The developers, the testers, the business analyst, the delivery manager. Everyone.

Then we would want the development process to take the least time possible, and thus involve the least amount of work possible, so that we have time to focus on the thing that really matters: our customers.

This is product engineering.

As product engineers we want to solve customers problems and make customers happier, we want to spend our time:

1. Serving our customers better today, by:
   - Understanding how we are serving our customers through observability and monitoring
   - Rapidly responding to and dealing with customer-originated incidents
   - Improving how we serve our customers through improvements and defect fixes
2. Preparing for the customers of tomorrow, by:
   - Researching what our customers need, want and would love
   - Conducting experiments to understand the value and viability of ideas

To achieve this, we must minimise the cognitive load and time taken to develop and deliver software.

**The less work the better**: if automation can do it, it should do it.

**The less code the better**: ideally no code, and if tools like AI let us write code faster so we can build digital products faster, as a product engineer this is A Good Thingâ„¢, not something to be afraid of.

**The less waste (blocking) the better**: if it can be done asynchronously it should be, processes must be just-in-time, and we must trust and empower people instead of gate keeping.

**The less hand-offs the better**: if one person can do it then it is better than two, if two people can work collaboratively together in parallel it is better than in serial.

**The more adaptible the people the better**: we should hire for intellect over specific skills or knowledge, and ideally we should have no specific roles to avoid pigeonholing (either extrinsic or intrinsic), leaving teams to self-organise.

As product engineers, our value is in our ability to understand our customers and solve their problems as efficiently and excellently as possible using whatever tools are available.

Today these skills may be expressed through designing or writing or testing or deploying software -- but tomorrow it could be more than of these or something else entirely, designing and writing and testing an AI prompt for instance, or configuring a no-code tool.

Whatever it is, we have nothing to fear.
