# website

[@josephearl](https://github.com/josephearl)â€™s website <https://www.josephearl.co.uk>.

Built using [Astro](https://astro.build) and served with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

## How it works

Content is stored as plain old Markdown in the `src/content` directory.

Static HTML is generated from the content using [Astro](https://astro.build) and saved into the `dist` directory.

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) detects changes to the Git repository and continually builds and deploys the site, as well as managing SSL certificates with Lets Encrypt.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
