title: "Winding down at the end of the work day"
---

Recently a good colleague at ThoughtWorks and the tech lead on my current project, Sophie Holden, has been taking a group of us through the ThoughtWorks tech lead training materials. 

This has involved a number of group whiteboard drawing sessions at the end of the day.

I've found that ending the work day with light-hearted, slightly physical activity such as a group whiteboard sketching activity really helps me leave work in a good mood.

And a good mood is something that wants to sustain itself -- delays, rudeness and other slight frustrations are easily dismissed -- I'm in a better mood on my commute home, and when I get home.
